    <h3>
      Chicken biryani is a delicious Pakistani/Indian rice dish that's typically
      reserved for special occasions such as weddings, parties, or holidays such
      as Ramadan. It has a lengthy preparation, but the work is definitely worth
      it. For biryani, basmati rice is the ideal variety to use.

      <ol>
        <li>
          Heat 2 tablespoons of oil in a large skillet. Fry potatoes in hot oil
          until lightly browned, about 3 to 5 minutes. Remove to a paper
          towel-lined plate to drain; set aside.
        </li>
        <li>
          Add remaining 2 tablespoons of oil to the skillet. Add onions, garlic,
          and fresh ginger; cook and stir until onion is soft and golden. Add
          tomatoes, salt, cumin, chili powder, pepper, and turmeric; cook,
          stirring constantly, for 5 minutes. Stir in yogurt, mint, ground
          cardamom, and cinnamon stick. Cover and cook over low heat, stirring
          occasionally, until tomatoes are cooked to a pulp. It may be necessary
          to add a little hot water if mixture becomes too dry and starts to
          stick to the pan.
        </li>
        <li>
          Add chicken and stir well to coat. Cover and cook over very low heat
          until chicken is tender, 35 to 45 minutes. There should only be a
          little very thick gravy left when chicken is finished cooking. If
          necessary cook uncovered for a few minutes to reduce the gravy.
        </li>
        <li>
          Meanwhile, make the rice: Wash rice well and drain in a colander for
          at least 30 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
          Heat oil in a large skillet. Add onion; cook and stir until golden.
          Add cardamom pods, cloves, cinnamon stick, ground ginger, and saffron;
          stir in rice until coated with spices.
        </li>
        <li>
          Heat stock and salt in a medium pot until hot; pour over rice and stir
          well. Add chicken mixture and potatoes; stir gently to combine. Bring
          to a boil. Reduce heat to very low, cover with a tight-fitting lid,
          and steam for 20 minutes without lifting the lid or stirring. Spoon
          biryani onto a warm serving dish.
